Data Analysis Methodology
Data collection and pre-processing Gather relevant data from network, employee access records, email, and other relevant sources Clean and pre-process the data, handling missing values and inconsistencies
Baseline establishment Establish a baseline of normal behavior for each employee, by analyzing historical data to understand typical access patterns, communication frequency, network activity, and resource usage Statistical methods  can be used to define normal ranges for these metrics
Anomaly detection Apply anomaly detection techniques to identify deviations from the established baselines This could include
Statistical anomalies Identifying data points that fall outside the expected statistical 
Behavioural anomalies Detecting changes in an employee's typical behaviour patterns
Rule-based anomalies Defining specific rules based on known threat
Correlation and Contextualization Correlate anomalies across different data sources to build a comprehensive picture of potentially suspicious activity records (eg, performance reviews, disciplinary actions) to understand potential motivations
Risk Scoring Assign risk scores to identified anomalies based on their severity and the likelihood of malicious intent This helps prioritize investigation efforts and focus on the most critical threats
Challenges and Balancing Privacy
Distinguishing Legitimate vs Malicious A key challenge is differentiating between legitimate work activities and malicious actions False positives are common Contextualization and correlation are crucial to reduce false positives
Privacy Rights Employee privacy must be respected Data collection should be minimized to what is absolutely necessary for the investigation Email content should only be accessed with proper legal authorization De-identification and anonymization techniques should be used whenever possible
Data Volume and Velocity Analyzing large volumes of data in real-time can be challenging Efficient data processing and analysis tools are essential
Transparency and Ethical Standards
Transparency Communicate the investigation process to employees, emphasizing the company's commitment to privacy and the reasons for the investigation
Ethical Guidelines Adhere to strict ethical guidelines throughout the investigation Avoid profiling or making assumptions based on personal characteristics Maintain confidentiality and data security
Legal Compliance Ensure all investigation activities comply with relevant laws and regulations
